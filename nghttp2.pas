     * contains peer's protocol list in preferable order.  The format of
     * |in| is length-prefixed and not null-terminated.  For example,
     * ``h2`` and ``http/1.1`` stored in |in| like this::
     *
     *     in[0] = 2
     *     in[1..2] = "h2"
     *     in[3] = 8
     *     in[4..11] = "http/1.1"
     *     inlen = 12
     *
     * The selection algorithm is as follows:
     *
     * 1. If peer's list contains HTTP/2 protocol the library supports,
     *    it is selected and returns 1. The following step is not taken.
     *
     * 2. If peer's list contains ``http/1.1``, this function selects
     *    ``http/1.1`` and returns 0.  The following step is not taken.
     *
     * 3. This function selects nothing and returns -1 (So called
     *    non-overlap case).  In this case, |out| and |outlen| are left
     *    untouched.
     *
     * Selecting ``h2`` means that ``h2`` is written into |*out| and its
     * length (which is 2) is assigned to |*outlen|.
     *
     * For ALPN, refer to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7301

     * To use this method you should do something like::
